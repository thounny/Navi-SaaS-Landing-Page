This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About the Project

Navi-SaaS-Landing-Page is a mock SaaS landing page inspired by **Navi**, used to access **The Wired** from *Serial Experiments Lain*. This project showcases a futuristic and minimalist design, blending the themes of interconnectedness and technology from the anime with cutting-edge web development techniques.

### Key Features:
1. **Next.js Basics:** Set up and structure a robust, scalable Next.js project with optimized performance.
2. **TailwindCSS Styling:** Utilize a utility-first approach for responsive and modern styling across all sections.
3. **Framer Motion Animations:** Add smooth and eye-catching animations to enhance the user experience.
4. **Complete Build:** A polished, deploy-ready project with sections including:
   - Hero Section
   - Features
   - FAQs
   - Footer

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load custom fonts.
